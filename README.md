App Idea:

    I would like to build an App to help international students transition smoothly from their home countries to colleges in the United States. It would have a checklist feature that helps the students keep track of requirements before classes start, for example, open a bank account. Other features could be reminders for visa renewals, information about public transportation and connection to other international students. I would call it i-Transition.
